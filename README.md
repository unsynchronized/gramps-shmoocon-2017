These are the presentations and files I used in my ShmooCon 2017 presentation about [gr-amps](https://github.com/unsynchronized/gr-amps).

The original Keynote file is [shmoocon-amps.key](shmoocon-amps.key).

I've exported it to PDF with presenter notes here: [shmoocon-amps-withnotes.pdf](shmoocon-amps-withnotes.pdf)

There's also a version with no notes: [shmoocon-amps.pdf](shmoocon-amps.pdf)

The [shmoocon-amps-html](shmoocon-amps-html) directory contains an HTML version of the presentation, but as with all machine-generated HTML, you should probably steer clear.
I've also hosted the above on github pages here: [https://unsynchronized.github.io/shmoocon-amps-html](https://unsynchronized.github.io/shmoocon-amps-html)

The [amps_focc.grc](amps_focc.grc) demo is a FOCC-TX-only flowgraph that I used for the first demo.  (For the subsequent two, I used the normal ampsbs.grc flowgraph in gr-amps itself.)

Many thanks to ShmooCon and the attendees for having me!
